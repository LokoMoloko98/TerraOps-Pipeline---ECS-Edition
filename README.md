# TerraOps Pipeline - ECS Edition

Automate the deployment of containerized applications on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Terraform using a robust CI/CD pipeline powered by AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and GitHub.

## Overview

This project empowers you to streamline the provisioning of ECS services while ensuring infrastructure integrity and code quality. With a structured CI/CD pipeline, it performs Terraform validation, planning, and application, making ECS deployment efficient and hassle-free.

## Key Features

- **CI/CD Automation:** Set up a seamless pipeline with AWS CodePipeline that automatically validates and deploys your Terraform configurations to ECS. Utilize AWS CodeBuild to perform Terraform validation, planning, and application.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Leverage Terraform's IaC principles for scalable and maintainable ECS infrastructure.

- **Code Quality Checks:** Verify your Terraform code with validation tools and formatting checks, ensuring clean and robust code.

- **Efficient ECS Deployments:** Implement a consistent and efficient process to deploy containerized applications on ECS.
